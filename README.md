# Coin Flipper

A small game that allows the user to flip a coin, gain a point on their guess, and level up.

## How To Use Locally:

After downloading files, open the backend folder in your command line terminal and install the node packages: npm install.
Then you can open the index file located in the frontend folder manually or using live server (VS Code Extension) or similar.

## How To Play:

Under "Your Guess" you can click the word (heart or star) to change your guess of which side the coin will land on.
Then you click on the spinning coin to flip it. The coin will show the randomly selected side it landed on.
If it macthes your guess you recieve a point and your score goes up by one.
Depending on the score reached, your level will change, there are sixteen total levels.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

The game randomly generates a number between 0 and 1 which represents heads or tails.

In the first version, we have a basic server without the use of any framework, just pure Node.js. Everything was done server-side, so no cors issues. I implemented an object to handle the different document types that the server will need to handle. I have two functions: one to handle the serving pages and content (using the object I mentioned) and one that handles the API actions. I also use an if condition to check which function needs to be run or I run Figlet for a custom 404 page. The API just spits out a random number and the index page uses a local JS to fetch the value and interpret it to head or tails on the page.

In version 2 I implemented the use of images to make the game more interesting. I added the images to my content object and serve them up on the page generated by the server. The frontend JS nows returns an image for heads and tails instead of text. The rest of the code remains the same.

For version 3 I added more visualization for the frontend code. With the use of a spinning coin to represent when you can flip the coin. Every time the coin is flipped you are shown the selected side and then (with setTimeOut) the coin spins again so you can flip it again.

Now version 4 adds a bit more functionality to the backend. Now the backend can serve up a predetermined level given a score passed to it as a parameter. Now the frontend displays a score, level and allows you to choose a side of the coin. It asks the server for a flip and sends the current score, it receives the selected side and a level based on the provided score.

## Optimizations

This game can still be improved to make it more enjoyable by adding better levels and options based on the type of player. Also, its implementation can be made more friendly by implementing a framework like Express to handle the server code.

## Lessons Learned:

This simple game in its different iterations provides a fun way to explore the creation of a project with Node. In the first, we see the creation of a server in pure node and how to get it to serve up information to a frontend. In the second version, we see that a pure Node.js server needs to be passed information that tells it how to handle every asset in a webpage like images, CSS, JS, etc. Also how to handle this in a modular fashion. In the third version, we used setTimeOut to handle the return of the base state of the game off the main thread since we want the player to see the result of the coin flip. For the fourth version, you see how to use the URL to send a value to the server and how the server can grab that value and return a value in response. Turning a simple coin flip game into, essentially, a clicker mini-game.
